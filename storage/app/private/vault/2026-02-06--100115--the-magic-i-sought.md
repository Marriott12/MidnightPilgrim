The magic I sought
Was buried in the places I avoided.
Maybe that’s why
I lost you
Before I ever had you.

Yeah… I think about us—
Sometimes.
But I get it now:
We were never meant to make it to the ending.
No epilogue.
Just ellipses.

So I gather my truth
Before I summon my strength.
I needed you
When I was breaking.
Not when your calendar cleared.
Not when it was convenient to care.

Now I see you,
Still posting pictures
In the shirt I left behind.
Still living in the shadows of almost.

But six feet…
Six feet is too far beneath you.

I still wish you find a love that mirrors your soul.
But don’t forget—
You turned me away
When I stood six feet from your door,
With both hands open,
And my heart in a paper bag.

You wrote our future in the sand
Just seconds before the wind came.
And I stood there,
Blue-faced,
Watching your deep blue eyes
Look everywhere
But at me.

You should’ve loved me
When I could still love you back.
When my hands were still reaching.
When my voice still cracked
Saying your name.

Forgive me—
But your pity parties?
They don’t move me anymore.

You should’ve shown up
When I was still setting the table.
When I carved our initials into tree bark,
When I painted a mural of us
On that weather-worn bench in the park—
Right after our first kiss.

Now it’s all echoes.
And six feet?
Six feet is too wide a silence.

May you find someone
Who meets you in the middle.
Not someone who waits
Until you’ve vanished
To want you.

We wrote our story in sand,
And watched the wind
Call it fiction.

I stood there,
Blue-faced,
Heart heavy,
As your eyes
—cold and infinite—
Turned away.

You withheld love
When I was full of it.
Now that it’s gone,
You remember me?

Too late.

No dance on my grave.
No second chances.
No crocodile tears
Over the ashes.

Six feet apart,
We mistook distance for destiny.

But truth is—
Our love didn’t die.

It never lived.
