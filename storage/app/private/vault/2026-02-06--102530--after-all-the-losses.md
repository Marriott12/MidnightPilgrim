After all the losses,
You’d think I’d have learned to let go.
But love—
It carves itself into you, deep and slow.
And when it leaves, it doesn’t just walk away—
It shatters.
It lingers.
Still, I stand in the rubble, calling your name.

So tonight, I speak to the shadows,
To the echoes caught between constellations.
I let the night cradle me,
Where your absence breathes in the cold moonlight.
No more tears to stain this earth,
No more cries to bring you back.
I hold the silence like it’s sacred—
Because inside it, you still live.

I’ll paint this grief in the colors you loved,
Unfolding passions you never got to see.
Your laughter—once a hymn—
Still beats in my chest.
A song that rises where silence falls,
An anthem to the life you left behind.
Even in the shadow of this endless night,
You remain my light.

“Damn, this hurt has weight—
But it’s carving out a strength I didn’t know could take shape.”

You taught me to find the light in the cracks,
To hold hope even when the world shuts its eyes.
Now you're the voice in the quiet,
The pulse in the storm,
The fire in my veins when I feel undone.
Love’s bittersweet taste still burns—
But I won’t let the ache define the road I run.

I’ll build a bridge from broken dreams,
Threaded with memory—still glowing, still gleams.
Because, damn, this grief is heavy,
But it's teaching me how to carry.
You’re gone,
But you breathe in my bones—
In every scar, in every line of the poem.

This is for you—
Every tear, every step,
Every whisper I send to the stars you now tread.

“Grief doesn’t break me; it remakes me.
From shattered dreams, I rise, unshaken.”

I’ll soar beyond clouds where your voice still calls,
No longer bound by these gravity walls.
Though the sorrow still sings,
I’ll walk through its flame—
Let the ashes become the roots of your name.

The chains of mourning can’t hold me still.
I rise. I climb.
I bend this world to my will.
This life, this loss, this love is mine—
And in every breath, I keep you divine.

So let the stars bear witness when I speak,
A voice cracked with sorrow, yet fire in its streak.
You’re the reason I find beauty in strife—
From your light,
I forge
A brand new life.
