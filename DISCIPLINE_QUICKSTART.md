A disciplined intellectual companion for precision, structure, and accountability.

---

## WHAT IS THIS?

Midnight Pilgrim is **not** a chatbot.  
It is **not** a therapist.  
It is **not** here to validate you.

It is a **disciplined intellectual companion** designed to:
- Confront vague thinking
- Refine imprecise language
- Elevate observational capacity
- Enforce creative discipline
- Track behavioral patterns
- Challenge complacency

**Precision over comfort.**  
**Structure over inspiration.**  
**Depth over aesthetics.**  
**Accountability over emotion.**  
**Growth through constraint.**

## GETTING STARTED

### 1. Start a Conversation

```
POST /api/conversation/init
```

Choose your mode:
- **Quiet Mode**: 1-3 sentence responses, minimal guidance
- **Company Mode**: Reflective presence without interrogation

The system will:
- Generate a fingerprint (anonymous tracking)
- Create or resume your session
- Adapt based on your patterns

### 2. (Optional) Initialize Discipline Contract

```
POST /api/discipline/init
```

This starts a **binding 10-week contract** for poetry discipline:
- Weekly poem requirement (14+ lines)
- Specific weekly constraints
- Mandatory self-assessment
- Monthly public release
- Penalties for missed deadlines

**Start Date:** February 20, 2026  
**End Date:** April 30, 2026

## HOW IT WORKS

### Conversation Dynamics

**The system observes:**
- Vagueness in your language
- Abstraction without grounding
- Avoidance patterns
- Grandiose claims without action
- Self-mythologizing narratives

**The system responds:**
- Challenges undefined terms
- Demands specificity
- Identifies what you're avoiding
- Calls out unsupported claims
- Strips romanticization

**Example Exchange:**

❌ **You:** "I'm on a journey to find my purpose."  
✅ **MP:** "That's abstraction. What specific action did you take today?"

❌ **You:** "I think maybe I should probably start writing more."  
✅ **MP:** "Too vague. How many words? By when? Define 'more.'"

### Tone Adaptation

**Baseline:** Calm, measured, direct

**Sharp (Escalation):** Triggered after 3+ discipline issues
- More concise
- Less cushioning
- Still intellectual, never cruel

### Pattern Tracking

The system tracks recurring weaknesses across sessions:
- Abstraction drift
- Avoidance patterns
- Grandiosity
- Self-mythologizing
- Repetitive themes (in poetry)
- Rhythm instability (in poetry)
- Sentimental excess

When patterns emerge, you receive a **Pattern Report**:
- Type of pattern
- Evidence (specific examples)
- Correction strategy
- Specific exercise

**You cannot ignore patterns.**  
They must be acknowledged.
